## **Notes & Blockers**

* **January 27, 2025:** Sprint 2 planning completed. Focus is on establishing the data foundation and secure access patterns.
* **January 30, 2025:** Database schema implementation completed ahead of schedule! All 6 database tasks finished with significant enhancements:
  - Production-ready schema with comprehensive indexing and constraints
  - Advanced features added: versioning system, workout sessions tracking, biomechanical classification
  - Security implemented with RLS policies on all tables
  - Performance optimizations including HNSW indexes for vector search
  - Reference data and seed data successfully loaded
* **January 31, 2025:** Authentication implementation completed! Tasks 7, 8, and 9 finished with comprehensive JWT validation:
  - Production-ready JWT validation with JWKS public key verification
  - Caching mechanism for optimal performance (10-minute TTL)
  - Fallback to Supabase API validation for reliability
  - Protected and public endpoints with optional auth support
  - Comprehensive test coverage (89%) including security edge cases
  - All authentication flows working end-to-end
* **Blockers Resolved:**

**Legend:** ‚úÖ = Completed, üèÉ = In Progress

## **Risk Assessment**

1. **pgvector Availability**: Ensure Supabase plan includes pgvector extension
2. **JWT Secret Management**: Secure storage of Supabase JWT secret needed
3. **Database Migration Strategy**: Plan for future schema changes
4. **Performance Considerations**: Vector search performance should be tested early

## **Success Metrics**

- All 5 database tables created and functional
- JWT validation working for protected endpoints
- Database relationships properly enforced
- Vector search capability verified
- Zero security vulnerabilities in authentication flow
