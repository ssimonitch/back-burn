   - Ready for comprehensive test coverage

## Rationale for Changes

### From Basic Logging to Professional Powerbuilding

**The Problem**: The initial implementation was suitable only for casual fitness tracking, lacking the granularity required for serious strength and hypertrophy training.

**The Solution**: The enhanced models now support:

1. **Periodization Management**:
   - Training phases allow athletes to track accumulation vs intensification blocks
   - Workout types enable proper stimulus management
   - Essential for long-term progressive overload

2. **Accurate Volume Tracking**:
   - Separating working sets from warmups prevents inflated volume numbers
   - Effective volume calculation focuses on sets that drive adaptation
   - Critical for managing training stress and recovery

3. **Progressive Overload Quantification**:
   - Intensity percentage tracking enables percentage-based programming
   - Estimated 1RM progression shows strength gains over time
   - Form quality degradation indicates when to deload

4. **Advanced Training Techniques**:
   - Set type classification supports drop sets, clusters, rest-pause
   - Equipment variations track different loading patterns
   - Range of motion quality helps identify mobility improvements

### Technical Decisions and Trade-offs

1. **Integer vs Enum for Form Quality**:
   - **Decision**: Use 1-5 integer scale
   - **Rationale**: Matches database exactly, provides granularity
   - **Trade-off**: Less type safety, but prevents data inconsistency

2. **Separate Effective vs Total Volume**:
   - **Decision**: Calculate both metrics
   - **Rationale**: Powerbuilders need to know actual training stimulus
   - **Trade-off**: Additional computation, but critical for training analysis

3. **Extensive Enum Usage**:
   - **Decision**: Create 8 new enums for training context
   - **Rationale**: Type safety and clear API documentation
   - **Trade-off**: More code, but better developer experience

4. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - **Decision**: Maintain all existing fields while adding new ones
   - **Rationale**: Don't break existing integrations
   - **Trade-off**: Larger models, but smooth migration path

## Impact on User Experience

1. **Better Training Decisions**:
   - Can see when effective volume drops (fatigue indicator)
   - Track workout-to-workout progression accurately
   - Identify optimal training phases for their goals

2. **Professional-Grade Analytics**:
