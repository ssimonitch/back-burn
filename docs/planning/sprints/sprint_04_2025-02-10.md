## **Technical Considerations**

### Data Model Design (Updated with Critical Fields)
- **Workout Sessions**:
  - Core: user_id, plan_id (nullable), started_at, completed_at
  - Training Context: workout_type, training_phase, overall_rpe
  - Wellness: mood, pre_workout_energy, post_workout_energy
  - Metrics: total_volume, total_sets (calculated)
- **Sets**:
  - Core: exercise_id, set_number, weight, reps
  - Classification: set_type (working/warmup/etc), intensity_percentage
  - Performance: rest_taken_seconds, tempo, rpe, reps_in_reserve
  - Quality: form_quality (1-5 scale), range_of_motion_quality
  - Advanced: reached_failure, failure_type, estimated_1rm
  - Context: equipment_variation, assistance_type
- **Calculated Fields**:
  - volume_load = weight × reps (GENERATED column)
  - effective_volume = sum(volume_load) WHERE set_type = 'working'
- **Relationships**: Sessions → Sets (1:M), Sets → Exercises (M:1)

### API Design Patterns
- **Contract-First Development**: OpenAPI contract defined before implementation
- **Nested Creation**: POST /workouts accepts session with nested sets array
- **Atomic Operations**: All sets created in single transaction with session
- **Pagination**: Consistent with Sprint 3 patterns (page, per_page, total)
- **Filtering**: Query parameters for date ranges and plan filtering
- **OpenAPI Verification**: Run `uv run poe verify-openapi` after each endpoint

### Repository Pattern Implementation
- **Protocol Definition**: WorkoutRepository abstract interface
- **DI Integration**: Register in src/core/di.py
- **Thin Repository**: Return raw dicts, let endpoints handle validation
- **Transaction Support**: Use Supabase transactions for multi-table operations

### Performance Considerations
- **Index Usage**: Leverage existing indexes on user_id, created_at, set_type
- **Query Optimization**: Use single query with joins for session+sets retrieval
- **Pagination Limits**: Default 20, max 100 items per page
- **Volume Calculations**:
  - Use database GENERATED columns for volume_load
  - Calculate effective_volume in application layer (working sets only)
  - Cache calculated metrics in workout_sessions table
- **Set Ordering**: Use set_number for consistent ordering within exercises

### Testing Strategy
- **Mock Repository**: Create mock_workout_repo fixture in conftest.py
- **Isolated Tests**: Mock dependencies to avoid database calls
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test happy path, validation, auth, and edge cases
- **Performance Tests**: Verify pagination and filtering efficiency

## **Success Criteria**

1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Users can log complete workout sessions with multiple sets
   - Both plan-based and ad-hoc workouts are supported
   - Workout history is retrievable with filtering and pagination
   - Individual workout details show all sets and exercises
   - Workouts can be deleted if logged incorrectly

2. **Technical Requirements**:
   - OpenAPI contract is defined first and drives implementation
   - All endpoints follow RESTful conventions
   - Authentication required for all operations
   - Minimum 80% test coverage maintained
   - Repository pattern consistently applied
   - OpenAPI documentation verified with no drift from implementation
   - Contract published to frontend for type generation

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - Cascade deletes maintain referential integrity
   - Transactions ensure atomic session+sets creation
   - Plan associations validated before persistence
   - Volume calculations accurate and consistent

## **Dependencies and Prerequisites**

### From Previous Sprints
- ✅ **Sprint 2**: workout_sessions and sets tables created with proper schema
- ✅ **Sprint 2**: JWT authentication system fully operational
- ✅ **Sprint 3**: Plans endpoints completed (needed for plan validation)
- ✅ **Sprint 3**: Repository pattern and DI established

### External Dependencies
- PostgreSQL database with existing schema
- Supabase client for data operations
- Valid exercises in database for set logging

### Will Enable
- **Sprint 5**: Exercise library can show usage statistics
- **Sprint 6**: AI can reference workout history in conversations
- **Sprint 7**: Affinity system can track workout consistency
- **Frontend**: Complete workout logging UI implementation

## **Risk Mitigation**

| Risk                                     | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                            |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Complex nested data validation           | Medium | Use Pydantic's nested model validation         |
| Transaction failures with multiple sets  | High   | Implement proper rollback handling             |
| Performance with large workout histories | Medium | Implement efficient pagination and indexing    |
| Plan-workout association complexity      | Low    | Clear validation rules and error messages      |
| Form quality scale mismatch              | High   | Ensure API uses 1-5 integer matching database  |
| Missing critical training fields         | High   | Add all fields before MVP release              |
| Volume calculation accuracy              | Medium | Separate warm-up from working set calculations |
