## **Tasks**

This board follows the "Rule of One": Only one item should be in the "IN PROGRESS" section at any time.

### **TODO**

* [ ] **Task 7: Implement Plan Business Logic Service**
  - **Description**: Create service layer for plan operations and business rules
  - **User Story**: As a developer, I want centralized business logic so that plan operations are consistent and maintainable

  - Generic PaginatedResponse model created for reusability
  - All validation rules implemented with Pydantic field constraints

* [x] **Task 2: Implement POST /api/v1/plans Endpoint** (Completed February 5, 2025)
  - Endpoint successfully creates plans with proper authentication
  - Returns 201 status with created plan data
  - Full validation and error handling implemented

* [x] **Task 3: Implement GET /api/v1/plans Endpoint** (Completed February 5, 2025)
  - Pagination support with PaginatedResponse structure
  - Filters deleted plans, sorts by created_at DESC
  - Returns items/total/page/per_page structure

* [x] **Task 4: Implement GET /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} Endpoint** (Completed February 5, 2025)
  - Supports both private plans (auth required) and public plans
  - Optional authentication for public plan viewing
  - Proper 404 handling for non-existent/unauthorized plans

* [x] **Task 5: Implement PUT /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} Endpoint** (Completed February 5, 2025)
  - Full versioning support implemented
  - Creates new version while maintaining immutability
  - Complete validation and ownership checks

* [x] **Task 6: Implement DELETE /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} Endpoint** (Completed February 5, 2025)
  - Soft delete implementation (sets deleted_at timestamp)
  - Prevents deletion of plans with active sessions
  - Returns 204 No Content on success

## **Notes & Blockers**

* **February 3, 2025:** Sprint 3 planning completed. Strong foundation from Sprint 2 enables focused development on plan CRUD operations.
* **February 5, 2025:** Remarkable progress - Tasks 1-6 (all Plan CRUD endpoints) completed in a single day!
  - All endpoints implemented with proper authentication and validation
  - Comprehensive test suite created (26 tests, 70% code coverage)
  - Code significantly refactored for efficiency (tests reduced from 4,237 to 821 lines)
  - All code quality checks passing (lint, typecheck, format)
* **Key Dependencies Available:**
  - ✅ Plans table exists with versioning system and constraints
  - ✅ JWT authentication working with require_auth dependency
  - ✅ RLS policies configured for secure data access
  - ✅ FastAPI project structure established
* **Blockers:** None identified - all prerequisites met
* **AI Assistant Log:** Sprint 3 planning created by sprint-manager agent focusing on plan CRUD functionality

**Legend:** ✅ = Completed, 🏃 = In Progress, 📅 = Planned

## **Risk Assessment**

1. **Versioning Complexity**: Plan updates create new versions - ensure atomic operations
   - **Mitigation**: Use database transactions, test version conflicts thoroughly
2. **RLS Policy Conflicts**: Complex queries may conflict with row-level security
   - **Mitigation**: Test all endpoints with multiple user scenarios
3. **Performance with Large Plan Lists**: Pagination and filtering performance concerns
   - **Mitigation**: Test with larger datasets, optimize queries if needed
4. **Concurrent Plan Updates**: Multiple users editing shared plans
   - **Mitigation**: Implement optimistic locking with version checking

## **Success Metrics**

- All 5 CRUD endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) functional and secure
- Plan versioning system working correctly
- Comprehensive test coverage (>85%) with all edge cases
- API documentation complete and accurate
- Zero security vulnerabilities in plan access control
- Performance acceptable for expected user loads
- Integration with existing authentication system seamless

## **Technical Considerations**

**Building on Sprint 2 Foundation:**
- Plans table already includes sophisticated versioning with version_number, is_current_version
- RLS policies already configured for secure user data access
- JWT authentication system ready for protecting all endpoints
- Database constraints and indexes already optimized

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Use existing require_auth dependency for all endpoints except public plan viewing
- Leverage RLS policies for automatic user filtering - no manual WHERE clauses needed
- Implement proper HTTP status codes: 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 204 (No Content), 404 (Not Found)
- Version management should be handled in service layer, not directly in endpoints
- All database operations should use transactions for data consistency
