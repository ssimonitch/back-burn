**Legend:** ✅ = Completed, 🏃 = In Progress, 📅 = Planned

## **Risk Assessment**

1. **Versioning Complexity**: Plan updates create new versions - ensure atomic operations
   - **Mitigation**: Use database transactions, test version conflicts thoroughly
2. **RLS Policy Conflicts**: Complex queries may conflict with row-level security
   - **Mitigation**: Test all endpoints with multiple user scenarios
3. **Performance with Large Plan Lists**: Pagination and filtering performance concerns
   - **Mitigation**: Test with larger datasets, optimize queries if needed
4. **Concurrent Plan Updates**: Multiple users editing shared plans
   - **Mitigation**: Implement optimistic locking with version checking

## **Success Metrics**

- All 5 CRUD endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) functional and secure
- Plan versioning system working correctly
- Comprehensive test coverage (>85%) with all edge cases
- API documentation complete and accurate
- Zero security vulnerabilities in plan access control
- Performance acceptable for expected user loads
- Integration with existing authentication system seamless

## **Technical Considerations**

**Building on Sprint 2 Foundation:**
- Plans table already includes sophisticated versioning with version_number, is_current_version
- RLS policies already configured for secure user data access
- JWT authentication system ready for protecting all endpoints
- Database constraints and indexes already optimized

**Key Implementation Notes:**
- Use existing require_auth dependency for all endpoints except public plan viewing
- Leverage RLS policies for automatic user filtering - no manual WHERE clauses needed
- Implement proper HTTP status codes: 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 204 (No Content), 404 (Not Found)
- Version management should be handled in service layer, not directly in endpoints
- All database operations should use transactions for data consistency
