# **Sprint 2: Authentication & Database Schema**

Sprint Duration: January 27, 2025 - February 2, 2025  
Primary Goal: Establish secure authentication flow and implement complete database schema for the AI Fitness Companion.

**Sprint Status: üèÉ IN PROGRESS (60% Complete)**
- Database Tasks: ‚úÖ 6/6 COMPLETED
- Authentication Tasks: üèÉ 1/4 IN PROGRESS
- Total Tasks: 6/10 COMPLETED

## **Tasks**

This board follows the "Rule of One": Only one item should be in the "IN PROGRESS" section at any time.

### **TODO**

* [ ] **Task 7: Design JWT Validation Flow**
  - Description: Plan the authentication flow for validating Supabase JWTs in FastAPI
  - User Story: As a user, I want secure access to my data so that only I can view and modify it
  - Dependencies: None
  - Estimated Effort: 2 hours
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Authentication flow documented
    - JWT validation process defined
    - Error handling scenarios identified
    - Security considerations addressed
  - Assigned To: api-architect agent for flow design

* [ ] **Task 8: Implement JWT Validation Dependency**
  - Description: Create a FastAPI dependency that validates incoming Supabase JWTs
  - User Story: As a user, I want my API requests authenticated so that my data remains private
  - Dependencies: Task 7
  - Estimated Effort: 4 hours
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Dependency validates JWT signature
    - Extracts user_id from valid tokens
    - Returns appropriate errors for invalid tokens
    - Can be applied to protected endpoints
  - Assigned To: Developer for implementation

* [ ] **Task 9: Create Protected Endpoint Example**
  - Description: Build a sample protected endpoint to verify authentication is working
  - User Story: As a developer, I want to test that authentication works so that I can build secure endpoints
  - Dependencies: Task 8
  - Estimated Effort: 1 hour
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - Endpoint requires valid JWT
    - Returns user-specific data when authenticated
    - Returns 401 error when unauthenticated
    - Includes proper error messages
  - Assigned To: Developer for implementation

* [ ] **Task 10: Document Database Relationships**
  - Description: Create clear documentation of all table relationships and constraints
  - User Story: As a developer, I want relationship documentation so that I can write correct queries
  - Dependencies: Tasks 2-6
  - Estimated Effort: 2 hours
  - Acceptance Criteria:
    - ER diagram or relationship map created
    - Foreign key relationships documented
    - Cascade behaviors defined
    - Query examples provided (conceptual only)
  - Assigned To: Developer or database-architect agent

## **Notes & Blockers**

* **January 27, 2025:** Sprint 2 planning completed. Focus is on establishing the data foundation and secure access patterns.
* **January 30, 2025:** Database schema implementation completed ahead of schedule! All 6 database tasks finished with significant enhancements:
  - Production-ready schema with comprehensive indexing and constraints
  - Advanced features added: versioning system, workout sessions tracking, biomechanical classification
  - Security implemented with RLS policies on all tables
  - Performance optimizations including HNSW indexes for vector search
  - Reference data and seed data successfully loaded
* **Blockers Resolved:** 
  - ‚úÖ Supabase project created and configured
  - ‚úÖ pgvector extension enabled successfully
  - ‚è≥ Still need Supabase service role key for backend JWT validation (Task 8 dependency)
* **AI Assistant Log:** 
  - Sprint planning created by sprint-manager agent to organize authentication and database tasks
  - Database schema designed and implemented by database-architect agent with production-ready enhancements

**Legend:** ‚úÖ = Completed, üèÉ = In Progress

## **Risk Assessment**

1. **pgvector Availability**: Ensure Supabase plan includes pgvector extension
2. **JWT Secret Management**: Secure storage of Supabase JWT secret needed
3. **Database Migration Strategy**: Plan for future schema changes
4. **Performance Considerations**: Vector search performance should be tested early

## **Success Metrics**

- All 5 database tables created and functional
- JWT validation working for protected endpoints
- Database relationships properly enforced
- Vector search capability verified
- Zero security vulnerabilities in authentication flow
