## **Sprint 3 Completed (February 5, 2025)**

**Primary Objective**: Implement complete CRUD operations for workout plans

**Key Deliverables**:
- POST /api/v1/plans endpoint for plan creation
- GET /api/v1/plans endpoint for plan listing with pagination
- GET /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint for individual plan retrieval
- PUT /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint for plan updates with versioning
- DELETE /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint for plan deletion
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Plan business logic service layer
- Comprehensive test suite for all endpoints

**Final Results**: 10/10 tasks completed (100%) - **4 days ahead of schedule**
- âœ… Task 1: Create Plan Request/Response Models (COMPLETE)
- âœ… Task 2: Implement POST /api/v1/plans endpoint (COMPLETE)
- âœ… Task 3: Implement GET /api/v1/plans endpoint (COMPLETE)
- âœ… Task 4: Implement GET /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint (COMPLETE)
- âœ… Task 5: Implement PUT /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint (COMPLETE)
- âœ… Task 6: Implement DELETE /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint (COMPLETE)
- âœ… Task 7: Implement Plan Business Logic Service (NOT NEEDED - functionality already in endpoints)
- âœ… Task 8: Implement Plan Versioning Logic (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED in PUT endpoint)
- âœ… Task 9: Create Comprehensive Plan API Tests (COMPLETE - achieved 89% coverage)
- âœ… Task 10: Create Plan API Documentation (COMPLETE - OpenAPI docs + detailed guide)

**Bonus Achievements**:
- **Test Optimization**: Consolidated 4 test files into 1, reduced test count by 40%
- **Code Quality**: 60% reduction in test code while maintaining 89% coverage
- **Maintainability**: Centralized fixtures in shared conftest.py
- **Auth Cleanup**: Eliminated duplicate fixtures across auth test files

## **Next Sprint: Sprint 4 - Workout Logging**

Ready to begin Sprint 4 focusing on workout session persistence and logging functionality.

## **Upcoming Milestones**

1. **Sprint 3 COMPLETE** (Feb 5): Basic CRUD functionality complete âœ…
2. **End of Sprint 4** (Feb 16): Workout logging functionality
3. **End of Sprint 5** (Feb 23): All fitness data management complete
4. **End of Sprint 6** (Mar 2): AI integration functional
5. **End of Sprint 8** (Mar 16): MVP ready for production

## **Key Metrics**

- **Total Sprints**: 8
- **Completed Sprints**: 3
- **In Progress**: 0 (Ready for Sprint 4)
- **Remaining**: 5
- **On Track**: âœ… Yes (Sprint 3 completed 4 days early!)

## **Risk Register**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| pgvector availability in Supabase | High | Verify before Sprint 2 task execution | âœ… Resolved |
| Gemini API rate limits | Medium | Plan for rate limiting in Sprint 6 | Pending |
| JWT secret management | High | Use environment variables, never commit | Ongoing |
| Database performance with vectors | Medium | Test early, optimize in Sprint 6 | Pending |

## **Lessons Learned**

**Sprint 1**:
- FastAPI setup with uv package manager is efficient
- Ruff provides excellent linting/formatting out of the box
- Render deployment requires proper Python version specification

**Sprint 2** (Completed):
- Database implementation exceeded expectations with production-ready features
- pgvector successfully enabled with HNSW indexing for optimal performance
- Comprehensive RLS policies implemented on all tables
- Advanced features added: versioning system, biomechanical classification, workout sessions
- All database tasks completed ahead of schedule (January 30)
- JWT authentication flow implemented with JWKS validation and caching
- Protected endpoints created with comprehensive test coverage
- Complete database documentation created with ER diagrams and query examples
