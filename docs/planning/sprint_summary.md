# **Sprint Summary - AI Fitness Companion Backend**

## **Project Overview**

This document tracks the progress of all sprints for the AI Fitness Companion backend development. The project follows an 8-week MVP timeline with weekly sprints.

**Development Environment**: Solo developer working with Claude Code AI assistance  
**Methodology**: Simplified Kanban with sprint-based planning

## **Sprint Status Overview**

|--------|------|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| Sprint 1 | Foundation & Setup | ✅ Complete | January 20, 2025 | FastAPI initialized, Ruff configured, Render deployment successful |
| Sprint 2 | Authentication & Database Schema | 🏃 In Progress (60%) | Target: Feb 2, 2025 | Database schema ✅, JWT validation 🏃 |
| Sprint 3 | Plan Creation | 📅 Planned | Target: Feb 9, 2025 | CRUD endpoints for workout plans |
| Sprint 4 | Workout Logging | 📅 Planned | Target: Feb 16, 2025 | Workout session persistence |
| Sprint 5 | Exercise Library | 📅 Planned | Target: Feb 23, 2025 | Exercise database and search |
| Sprint 6 | AI - Chat Interface & Semantic Memory | 📅 Planned | Target: Mar 2, 2025 | Gemini integration and vector search |
| Sprint 7 | AI - Affinity System | 📅 Planned | Target: Mar 9, 2025 | Affinity scoring logic |
| Sprint 8 | Final Testing & Security | 📅 Planned | Target: Mar 16, 2025 | Security review and deployment prep |

## **Current Sprint Focus (Sprint 2)**

**Primary Objective**: Establish secure authentication and complete database schema

**Key Deliverables**:
- Database schema design for all tables
- Implementation of Users, Plans, Exercises, Sets, and Memories tables
- pgvector configuration for semantic search
- JWT validation dependency in FastAPI
- Protected endpoint example

**Progress**: 6/10 tasks completed (60%)
- ✅ Database schema design (enhanced with production features)
- ✅ All 5 database tables created with RLS policies
- ✅ pgvector enabled with HNSW indexing
- 🏃 JWT validation flow design in progress
- ⏳ JWT implementation pending
- ⏳ Protected endpoint example pending

## **Upcoming Milestones**

1. **End of Sprint 3** (Feb 9): Basic CRUD functionality complete
2. **End of Sprint 5** (Feb 23): All fitness data management complete
3. **End of Sprint 6** (Mar 2): AI integration functional
4. **End of Sprint 8** (Mar 16): MVP ready for production

## **Key Metrics**

- **Total Sprints**: 8
- **Completed Sprints**: 1
- **In Progress**: 1
- **Remaining**: 6
- **On Track**: ✅ Yes

## **Risk Register**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| pgvector availability in Supabase | High | Verify before Sprint 2 task execution | ✅ Resolved |
| Gemini API rate limits | Medium | Plan for rate limiting in Sprint 6 | Pending |
| JWT secret management | High | Use environment variables, never commit | Ongoing |
| Database performance with vectors | Medium | Test early, optimize in Sprint 6 | Pending |

## **Lessons Learned**

**Sprint 1**:
- FastAPI setup with uv package manager is efficient
- Ruff provides excellent linting/formatting out of the box
- Render deployment requires proper Python version specification

**Sprint 2** (In Progress):
- Database implementation exceeded expectations with production-ready features
- pgvector successfully enabled with HNSW indexing for optimal performance
- Comprehensive RLS policies implemented on all tables
- Advanced features added: versioning system, biomechanical classification, workout sessions
- All database tasks completed ahead of schedule (January 30)
