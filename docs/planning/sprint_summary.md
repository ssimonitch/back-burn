## **Current Sprint Focus (Sprint 3)**

**Primary Objective**: Implement complete CRUD operations for workout plans

**Key Deliverables**:
- POST /api/v1/plans endpoint for plan creation
- GET /api/v1/plans endpoint for plan listing with pagination
- GET /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint for individual plan retrieval
- PUT /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint for plan updates with versioning
- DELETE /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint for plan deletion
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Plan business logic service layer
- Comprehensive test suite for all endpoints

**Progress**: 6/10 tasks completed (60%)
- ✅ Task 1: Create Plan Request/Response Models (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Task 2: Implement POST /api/v1/plans endpoint (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Task 3: Implement GET /api/v1/plans endpoint (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Task 4: Implement GET /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Task 5: Implement PUT /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Task 6: Implement DELETE /api/v1/plans/{plan_id} endpoint (COMPLETE)
- 📅 Task 7: Implement Plan Business Logic Service
- 📅 Task 8: Implement Plan Versioning Logic
- 📅 Task 9: Create Comprehensive Plan API Tests (partially complete - 26 tests written)
- 📅 Task 10: Create Plan API Documentation

## **Upcoming Milestones**

1. **End of Sprint 3** (Feb 9): Basic CRUD functionality complete
2. **End of Sprint 5** (Feb 23): All fitness data management complete
3. **End of Sprint 6** (Mar 2): AI integration functional
4. **End of Sprint 8** (Mar 16): MVP ready for production

## **Key Metrics**

- **Total Sprints**: 8
- **Completed Sprints**: 2
- **In Progress**: 1 (Sprint 3)
- **Remaining**: 5
- **On Track**: ✅ Yes

## **Risk Register**

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|--------|
| pgvector availability in Supabase | High | Verify before Sprint 2 task execution | ✅ Resolved |
| Gemini API rate limits | Medium | Plan for rate limiting in Sprint 6 | Pending |
| JWT secret management | High | Use environment variables, never commit | Ongoing |
| Database performance with vectors | Medium | Test early, optimize in Sprint 6 | Pending |

## **Lessons Learned**

**Sprint 1**:
- FastAPI setup with uv package manager is efficient
- Ruff provides excellent linting/formatting out of the box
- Render deployment requires proper Python version specification

**Sprint 2** (Completed):
- Database implementation exceeded expectations with production-ready features
- pgvector successfully enabled with HNSW indexing for optimal performance
- Comprehensive RLS policies implemented on all tables
- Advanced features added: versioning system, biomechanical classification, workout sessions
- All database tasks completed ahead of schedule (January 30)
- JWT authentication flow implemented with JWKS validation and caching
- Protected endpoints created with comprehensive test coverage
- Complete database documentation created with ER diagrams and query examples
